## The Three Levels of Listening

- from Alistair Cockburn’s Agile Software Development
- How a person learns and masters a technique, passing through three levels:
  - **Following** - The level where the learner looks for one very detailed process that works and sticks to it to accomplish a task
  - **Detaching** - The level where the learner feels comfortable with one method and begins to learn other ways to accomplish the same task
  - **Fluent** - The level where the learner has experience with or understanding of many methods and doesn't think of any of them in particular while doing a task

## Sysadmins, Programmers, and DevOps

### System Administrators / sysadmins

- People who keep servers and networks up and running
- Their role is sometimes called *operations*
- They deal with software installation and configuration, and security

### Programmers

- People who write software
- Programmer vs. Developer
- Work with others to create the applications that run on top of systems

### DevOps

- Portmanteau of *developer* and *operations*
- IT world is changing and roles are becoming less clear-cut and isolated from one another
- Developers usually are interested in new technologies
- Operations usually are interested in stability
- Two conflicting goals - should not be so
